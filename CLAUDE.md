# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chrome extension called "AI 编程提示词生成器" (AI Programming Prompt Generator) that extracts webpage elements and generates detailed AI prompts for code recreation. It's a three-in-one tool that provides:

1. **Smart Prompt Generation**: Select webpage elements to generate detailed coding instructions
2. **Page Data Extraction**: Extract comprehensive page structure and styling  
3. **PRD Generation**: Generate Product Requirements Documents

## Development Commands

### Extension Development
```bash
# Build for development
npm run build

# Build for production (extension package)
npm run build:ext

# Preview build
npm run preview
```

### Backend Development (Optional)
The project includes an optional Python FastAPI backend for PRD generation:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python start.py
```

### Testing the Extension
- Load unpacked extension from `public/` directory in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
- Enable developer mode
- Refer to `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing procedures

### Development Workflow
- After making changes to files in `public/`, reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`)
- No build step required for basic extension development (files are used directly from `public/`)
- Use `npm run build` only for creating optimized distribution packages

## Architecture Overview

### Chrome Extension Structure (Manifest V3)
- **`public/manifest.json`**: Extension manifest defining permissions, content scripts, and service worker
- **`public/content.js`**: Content script injected into all web pages for element selection and DOM manipulation
- **`public/background.js`**: Service worker handling extension lifecycle and inter-script communication
- **`public/sidepanel.js`**: Main UI logic with three integrated features (prompt generation, data extraction, PRD)
- **`public/sidepanel.html/css`**: Side panel interface

### Build System
- Uses Vite with TypeScript configuration for development builds
- Entry point: `public/sidepanel.html` 
- Build outputs to `dist/` directory
- Files in `public/` directory are used directly for development (no compilation needed)
- `copyPublicDir: true` ensures all public files are included in builds

### Key Technical Patterns

**Element Selection System**:
- Content script creates visual overlays and highlighting for element selection
- Uses `getComputedStyle` API for accurate style extraction
- Recursive DOM traversal for complete element analysis
- Message passing between content script and side panel via background script

**API Integration**:
- OpenRouter API integration for intelligent prompt generation (search for "openrouter.ai" in sidepanel.js)
- Optional FastAPI backend integration for PRD generation
- Chrome storage API for user preferences and data persistence

**Chrome Extension Communication**:
- Service worker pattern (background.js) for Manifest V3 compliance
- Content script injection with `<all_urls>` permission
- Side panel API for persistent UI across browser sessions

## Code Conventions

### JavaScript Style
- ES6+ syntax with modern JavaScript features
- Extensive use of async/await for Chrome API calls
- Message passing pattern for cross-context communication
- Modular function organization with clear separation of concerns

### Chrome Extension Patterns
- Manifest V3 service worker architecture  
- Content script injection and communication
- Side panel API for persistent UI
- Storage API for settings persistence
- Tab and scripting permissions for cross-page functionality

## Important Development Notes

### Extension Requirements
- Chrome 88+ required for side panel support
- All URLs require explicit host permissions in manifest.json
- Content script runs on `<all_urls>` for universal element selection
- Backend integration is optional (only for PRD generation feature)

### API Configuration
- OpenRouter API key configured in `sidepanel.js` for intelligent prompt generation
- Uses GPT-4o-mini model for optimal cost/performance balance
- Fallback error handling for network issues
